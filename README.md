# House Price Prediction with XGBoost

This project predicts house prices using the XGBoost regressor model. It's based on the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" and uses the provided training and test datasets.  The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

Predicting house prices is a challenging regression task with real-world applications in real estate, finance, and urban planning.  This project demonstrates a robust approach to this problem using the powerful XGBoost algorithm.  It emphasizes the importance of careful data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve model accuracy.

## Dataset

The project uses the "train.csv" and "test.csv" datasets provided in the Kaggle competition. These datasets contain information about various features of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The target variable is "SalePrice."

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handles missing values by forward filling for both numerical and categorical features.
   - Converts categorical features into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
   - Combines training and testing data for consistent preprocessing.

2. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Standardizes numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure that features with larger values don't dominate the model.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Trains an `XGBRegressor` model with specified hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, eta, subsample, colsample_bytree). These hyperparameters might be tuned further for improved performance.

4. **Prediction and Postprocessing:**
   - Predicts SalePrice for the test set.
   - Inverse transforms the standardized numerical features in the test set back to their original scale.

5. **Output:**
   - Creates a "submission.csv" file containing the predicted SalePrices for the test set, ready for submission to the Kaggle competition.


## Dependencies

* **Python 3.7+**
* **Libraries:**  Install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost


## Usage

1. **Download Datasets:** Download "train.csv" and "test.csv" from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and place them in the same directory as the notebook.
2. **Run Notebook:** Open and run the "house-price-prediciton.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.  The `submission.csv` file will be generated in the same directory.


## Potential Improvements

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further optimize the XGBoost model's hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
* **Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms or polynomial features.
* **Model Selection:**  Experiment with other regression models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or neural networks.
* **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyze feature importance to gain insights into the drivers of house prices.
